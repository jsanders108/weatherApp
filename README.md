This is a React app which shows the current weather conditions for any U.S. city/state entered by the user. 
To access the information, I fetched the data from Coingecko's API. In a separate fetch request, I also brought in the current top trending coins on Coingecko's platform.

The app is dynamic and real-time, meaning it is updated with the latest Top 20 Coingecko data upon refresh.

The app is optimized for a mobile device, but, via media queries, can also be displayed on a desktop monitor.
